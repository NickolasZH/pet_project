# Description
The repository contains my pet-project on Computer Vision. <br>
As a topic I chose classification in the field of histology according to the catalog of images from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/colorectal-histology-mnist?select=Kather_texture_2016_image_tiles_5000">Kaggle</a>.
<br>
I used Pytorch as my main framework and adhered to basic principles of OOP.
